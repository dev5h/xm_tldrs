# This is not a Software or Coding related repository. You can ignore anyways.

**GitHub** is intended to be an open source collaboration among devs around the world. Now I understand this. But um I just wanted to dump my Science notes here so if anyone finds this accidentally can become benefited by this. 

## WTF is This ##

Well, this repo contains bunch of .odt files which is the file extension of [Libre Office Writter](https://github.com/LibreOffice) . And also somehow compiled PDF files of the Libre source ðŸ˜•.  Anyways.

## Tl;DR

Yes, this repo contains the TL;DRs of different topics of my upcoming exam that I wrote , write and writing myself. Tbh , I am not the perfect writer so I have to edit the odt files and compile (convert)'em in PDF again and again. Also I wanted them to upload in a cloud server so that I can access them from anywhere. So, I needed some sort of Version control over my docs . I thought I would just upload'em in my GDrive bt I don't thing they supports a VCS. So I remembered that aside from a student I am somewhat a Software Engineer myself. So Just did what an Engineer does. I made my Hand notes **Open Source** ;p
